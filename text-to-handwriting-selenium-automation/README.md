One script converts a hard coded line of text to handwriting. Another  takes a text file as input and converts all the lines to handwriting,  each line being separated by a new-line character. Selenium web  automation is used to achieve this. Furthermore, the chrome browser used has been made hidden, i.e., the script runs the tasks in the  background, and hence gives the illusion of a feel of using the command  line to get the desired result. Further improvements to the script are  welcome, as only a few of the options have been scripted.

#### DEPENDENCIES

$ pip install selenium

Download ChromeDriver from https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/wiki/ChromeDriver

[Note: In the given script, we've used ChromeDriver. You're free to use webdriver for your preferred browser. Also change the CHROMEDRIVER_PATH if required.]

#### PS:

Before running the script, launch the app locally, or replace the URL with the hosted app's URL in the script.
